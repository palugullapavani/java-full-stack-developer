  <p>Bamboo is a vast topic, and if you decide to plant, harvest, 
    design, or build your own bamboo projects, you may encounter 
    many doubts along the way. At Bamboo U, we understand the importance 
    of having these questions answered, which is why we're here to help! 
    After carefully reviewing the questions we receive, we have selected 
    climatic conditions to forestry, treatment, and design.</p>
